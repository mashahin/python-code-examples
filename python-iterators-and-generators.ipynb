    "## Python Iterators & Iterables\n",
    "Iterables are objects capable of returning their members one at a time – they can be iterated over. Popular built-in Python data structures such as lists, tuples, and sets qualify as iterables. Other data structures like strings and dictionaries are also considered iterables: a string can produce iteration of its characters, and the keys of a dictionary can be iterated upon. As a rule of thumb, consider any object that can be iterated over in a for-loop as an iterable. "
