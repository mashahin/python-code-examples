    "# Data Streams:\n",
    "A stream is a sequence of elements. With map(), filter(), and reduce() – the three cornerstone functions of functional programming – you can operate over a sequence of elements. In this article, we will learn how to work with streams in Python  like we work with them in Java.\n",

    "But first, let’s say a word about functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is Functional Programming?\n",
    "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that breaks down a problem into individual functions. Every function, if possible, takes a set of input arguments and produces an output. In this paradigm, we avoid mutable data types and state changes as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also emphasizes RECURSION rather than loops, focusing on lists, PURE FUNCTIONS, and HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will explore map(), filter(), and reduce() in Python. These are the Python methods used to perform the MAPPING, FILTERING, and REDUCING operations that are fundamental in functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s note that map(), filter(), and reduce() are written in C and are highly optimized in terms of speed and memory usage, making them a better choice than the regular Python for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a prerequisite, it is essential to have some knowledge of functions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working on Streams in Python:  map()\n",
    "map() takes a function and one or more iterables as arguments. The output is an iterator that returns the transformed items.\n",
    "\n",
    "SYNTAX: map(function, iterable[, iterable1, iterable2,..., iterableN])\n",
    "\n",
    "ThE first argument to map() is a transformation function, where each original item is transformed into a new one. It can be any Python callable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you need to take a list of numeric values and transform it into a list containing the cube value of every number in the original list. You can use a for loop and code something like this:"
